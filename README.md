## Day 1: Palindromes and anagrams

### Requirements:

* Write a program that asks for a string.
* The program displays this string inverted.
* The program checks if the string is a palindrome and displays a message informing you about it.
* When checking the string, the program ignores capital letters and non-letter characters.
* The program calls a website that will display anagrams of the given text.

### I learned today:

* Regular Expressions or regex
* time function that delayed opening of the browser
* how to open the url via the application

## Day 2: Page from Callendar

### Requirements:

* Write a program that, when started, displays the current date, time, day of the week and weather, i.e. temperature and pressure in a given city.
* Use requests and datetime.
* Convert units from, for example: Calvin to Celsius
* Hard version: Display the current time for cities in different time zones (e.g. Beijing, Sydney, Washington, London)

### I learned today:

* library requests
* library datetime
* library random

## Day 3: Mail Sender

Write a simple program that will send personalized mailing to selected people.

### Requirements:

* database: excel or csv file with two columns with the headings "email" and "name and surname"
* email subject: “Your image”
* personalized email content: “Hi {Name}! it’s file generated for you”.
* in addition to the mail: graphic file named "{Name} _ {Surname} _image.png"
* Properly secure the program (e.g. missing Excel file, missing data in Excel, no png file)
* protect against spam (e.g. one e-mail sent every second)
* Hard version: add an option to send emails with HTML content
* Hard version: add an email validator
