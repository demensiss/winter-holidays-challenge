## Day 1: Palindromes and anagrams

[Solving the task](https://github.com/demensiss/winter-holidays-challenge/blob/master/palindrom-and-anagram.py)

### Requirements:

[x] Write a program that asks for a string.
[x] The program displays this string inverted.
[x] The program checks if the string is a palindrome and displays a message informing you about it.
[x] When checking the string, the program ignores capital letters and non-letter characters.
[x] The program calls a website that will display anagrams of the given text.
[ ] Hard version: Search for anagrams and words formed after removing letters from the given word yourself

### Program status:

The basic requirements are made. The program doesn't report errors. 
Hard version under development.

### I learned today:

* Regular Expressions or regex
* time function that delayed opening of the browser
* how to open the url via the application

## Day 2: Page from Callendar

[Solving the task](https://github.com/demensiss/winter-holidays-challenge/blob/master/page-from-callendar.py)

### Requirements:

[x] Write a program that, when started, displays the current date, time, day of the week and weather, i.e. temperature and pressure in a given city.
[x] Use requests and datetime.
[x] Convert units from, for example: Calvin to Celsius
[ ] Hard version: Display the current time for cities in different time zones (e.g. Beijing, Sydney, Washington, London)

### Program status:

## Day 3: Mail Sender

Write a simple program that will send personalized mailing to selected people.

### Requirements:

[ ] database: excel or csv file with two columns with the headings "email" and "name and surname"

[x] protect against spam (e.g. one e-mail sent every second)
[ ] Hard version: add an option to send emails with HTML content
[ ] Hard version: add an email validator

### Program status:

Program under development.

## Day 4: BMI Calculator

Write a program that calculates the BMI index based on weight [kg] and height [cm].

### Requirements:

[ ] the program gets the necessary information from the user
[ ] the program informs the user to what extent is its result
[ ] then the program randomizes one of the physical activities and the time of its execution
[ ] the execution time cannot be longer than the free time declared by the user
[ ] create a training plan for 7 days and save the results in a .txt file
[ ] Hard version: Prepare a varied training plan taking into account the maximum time entered by the user. It should be a few physical activities that will fill the entire daily amount of time, have a certain minimum length (e.g. 10 minutes). Activities cannot be repeated in one day.

### Program status:

Program under development.
