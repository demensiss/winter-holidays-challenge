## Day 1: Palindromes and anagrams

### Requirements:

* Write a program that asks for a string.
* The program displays this string inverted.
* The program checks if the string is a palindrome and displays a message informing you about it.
* When checking the string, the program ignores capital letters and non-letter characters.
* The program calls a website that will display anagrams of the given text.

### I learned today:

* Regular Expressions or regex
* time function that delayed opening of the browser
* how to open the url via the application

## Day 2: Page from Callendar

### Requirements:

* Write a program that, when started, displays the current date, time, day of the week and weather, i.e. temperature and pressure in a given city.
* Use requests and datetime.
* Convert units from, for example: Calvin to Celsius
* Hard version: Display the current time for cities in different time zones (e.g. Beijing, Sydney, Washington, London)
